## 🔒 Security

### 🔑 Private Key Storage

Your private key is securely stored in a JSON file, encrypted with a password of your choice. The encryption adds an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized parties to access your private key even if they gain access to the JSON file.

### 🔬 Transparency

We're as transparent as your ex's excuses. Our code is open-source, and we encourage you to dive in, explore, and contribute. Trust isn't given; it's earned and verified.

### 🔍 Security Audit

We encourage users to perform their own security audits. One easy way to do this is to copy the entire codebase into ChatGPT or another AI assistant and ask if the code appears secure or if there are any malicious intentions. This is a good practice for any open-source project you're considering using.
